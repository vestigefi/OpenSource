## Abstract
This proposal outlines the development of a decentralized perpetuals trading platform. The platform will facilitate seamless trading of perpetual contracts, initially supporting ALGO/USDC with the potential to expand to other liquid assets in the future. In addition, a decentralized oracle will be created to provide accurate and reliable on-chain price feeds for assets traded across decentralized exchanges (Dexes). This will enable precise pricing for perpetual contracts and other DeFi products, further enhancing the Algorand ecosystem.

## Roadmap
1. Month 1-2: Design and develop the core architecture for the decentralized perpetuals platform
2. Month 3: Implement the decentralized oracle for accurate on-chain price feeds across Dexes
3. Month 4: Integrate the perpetuals platform with the decentralized oracle for enhanced pricing
4. Month 5: Perform rigorous testing of the platform and oracle to ensure safety and reliability
5. Month 6: Officially launch the platform, provide comprehensive documentation, and offer ongoing support to users

## Benefits for the Community
