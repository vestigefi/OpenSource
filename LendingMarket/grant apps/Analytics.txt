## Abstract
This proposal aims to enhance and expand the Vestige.Fi analytics platform, a valuable resource for the Algorand ecosystem. The primary goals of this project are to add stable swap tracking and swapping functionality, open the aggregator as a white label service allowing users to easily integrate it into their projects, expand free services by offering easy-to-use chart embeddables connected to the platform, implement a basic timestamp transaction endpoint for "at a given time" price queries, and integrate lending pools from leading lending markets, such as Folks Finance and AlgoFi.
