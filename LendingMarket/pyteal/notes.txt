Some basic notes:
- BUR (borrow utilization rate)
    - Specifies borrow_amt / collateral_amt
    - A position is liquidateable if the BUR > 10000 - safety_margin - liquidation_incentive
    - A position is only allowed to open if the BUR < max_bur_take
        - if max_bur_take = 9250 the largest position that's possible to open is when 
          borrow_amt / collateral_amt < 92.5%
        - This also goes whenever an edit is made to an order, although 
          order changes are always allowed if they decrease the BUR.

- Orders are boxes
    - Names are Concat(Address, order_id)
        - order_id is super arbitrary (will probably change)
    - Contents are Concat(collateral (u64), borrow(u64), interest_per_tok(u128))
